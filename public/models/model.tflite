# Placeholder TensorFlow Lite Model File
# This is a placeholder file for the fish species identification model
# In a real implementation, this would be a binary .tflite model file
# The actual model would be trained on fish species data and converted to TensorFlow Lite format

# For this demo, the app will use a fallback prediction system
# The TensorFlow service will handle the missing model gracefully

# Model specs (when available):
# - Input: 224x224x3 RGB image
# - Output: 30 fish species classifications
# - Model size: ~10-15 MB
# - Inference time: ~100-300ms on mobile devices
